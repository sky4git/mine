Minesweeper game created in basic Javascript.

Use this code for learning purpose only. The game is created just to play with javascript(in 2012).
The code structure is not the best way it should be done. I recommend to recreate it using MVC architecture.
I will probably work on it again to recreate it using #ReactJS or Angular 2.

If you want to help me transition it into either of above mentioned javascript frameworks, please contribute.
